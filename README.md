### Sysex Description for AKAI MPK 2 series
This is a collection of notes and tools from reverse engineering the AKAI MPK261 controller.
I don't have access to other 2 series controllers, but I wouldn't be surprised if things were similar...

10 0c 0b yy {1546 bytes..} : program dump yy? (1-30) (Note 0c 0b = 1547 after MSB fix)
20 00 03 01 00 18 f7 : query address 18? returns: 30 00 04 01 00 18 yy
20 00 03 nn 00 18 f7
returns 30 00 03 nn 00 18 {xx bytes} f7

30 00 [n+3] nn xx xx yy : load global address x with n bytes y
returns 38 00 04 nn xx xx 00 on success?

31 00 04 01 xx xx yy : load program address x with data byte y? Works for pad addresses
31 00 43 40 xx xx {yy[0] .. yy[63]} : load address x with 64 bytes?
31 00 [n+3] nn xx xx {yy[0]..yy[n-1]} : load address x with n byte array y
return 39 00 04 nn xx xx 00 on success (01 on fail?)

Addresses:
00 01 -> 0x001 = current program #
00 18 -> 0x018 = current bank # (0-3)

Pad off colors:
0a 7c -> 0x57c = bank a pad 1 (first pad)
0b 1b -> 0x59b = bank b pad 16

Pad on colors:
0b 3c -> 0x5bc = bank a pad 1

Program dump format:
